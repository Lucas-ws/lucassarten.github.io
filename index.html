    <h1>Dive-Cylinder-Database</h1>
    <p> SQL Database application made in C# to track and manage customers and dive cylinder testing for a local dive
      training company.</p>
    <p2> I undertook this project as freelance work for a local dive training company in New Plymouth. They requested a
      database application to help modernise and streamline their dive cylinder testing process. This application is
      fully featured, including automatic batch email reminders and cloud backups. This version is deprecated so I've
      been given permission to showcase the code with personal information removed. </p2><br><br>

      <h1>Wordle-Guesser</h1>
      <p> C++ program that solved Wordle puzzles using letter frequency!</p>
      <p2> This was a fun afternoon project I started in a quest to find the statistically best Wordle starter words. As it turns out "alter" is the best starter word - this bot beats me in Wordle every time. </p2><br><br>

      <h1>League-AI</h1>
      <p> Simple Artificial Intelligence bot made for the multiplayer online video game League of Legends.</p>
      <p2> This bot was made to autonomously play the video game League of Legends without any user input. The bot
        mimics a real player using image detection to see. </p2><br><br>

      <h1>Tweet-Deleter</h1>
      <p> A simple command line java program to delete tweets, retweets, and likes from a
        twitter timeline.</p>
      <p2> My Twitter timeline was quite cluttered, so I made this application to help clean up my personal Twitter
        timeline on an automatically run schedule. </p2><br><br>

      <h1>AVC-Project</h1>
      <p> Month-long project I worked on with a fantastic team to develope a virtual autonomous robot vehicle.</p>
      <p2> The task of this project was to create a control system for a two-wheeled robot to navigate an obstacle
        course following a red line. </p2><br><br>
